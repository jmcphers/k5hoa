Dear Neighbors and Pool Community,
 
The HOA Board would like to invite Kingsgate 5 homeowners, residents, and the pool community to join us on **Thursday, August 5th from 5:30pm to 8:30pm at the Lower Field**. Catered dinner by QT Food Truck, kids’ activities, and certainly lots of **FUN** will be provided! Please come prepared with chairs and/or picnic blankets as well as your own beverages. If all possible, enjoy walking over together with your neighbors as the parking lot will be closed off to cars. Let’s save street parking for those who need it. We can’t wait to be together and celebrate all we’ve endured over the last year. 
 
Sincerely, 

Kingsgate Five HOA Board
