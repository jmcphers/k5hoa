Hello Kingsgate Five Homeowners,

Thank you to all our neighbors for their feedback and suggestions regarding improving the playground and the park. There have been a lot of great ideas shared and the discussions were both lively and informational.  

At the meeting on July 26th, many homeowners requested more information be shared about how a proposal had been arrived at and to seek additional bids. In response, the board and a committee of interested homeowners have completed a series of meetings to further discuss options and answer questions. A representative from Northwest Playground Equipment Inc.  attended and answered general questions about upgrading playground areas, our unique site, and presented proposals. Three proposals were presented to members in attendance.

Regarding additional bids, members of the committee approached four additional firms requesting proposals. Out of this effort, we had firms evaluate our site and discuss options. However, given the complexity of our site and limited services offered by, only one of the firms we contacted has the capability to do all phases of our project -- demolition, site preparation, installation, and warranty. After checking references and looking at completed projects by them, the committee is recommending and the board has selected Northwest Playground Equipment, Inc. For homeowners interested in seeing recent work completed by this firm, you can visit the playgrounds at [Kingsgate 3 & 4 Park](https://kingsgate3and4.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/kingsgate-rev-design-phased-pics.pdf) and [Wilmot Park](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x54900dd5530d8b11:0xebf2580bc862ed7c!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4shttps://mapofplay.kaboom.org/playspaces/4678!5swilmot+park+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e1!2shttps://s3.amazonaws.com/playspacefinder.kaboom.org/photos/photos/000/007/110/original/4678-7110.jpg?1378268638&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9nqzBydPWAhUR-2MKHUveAK0QoioIgwEwDg) in Woodinville. These playgrounds provide a comparable to the ideas being proposed.

The initial proposed $500 special assessment included both the playground upgrade and partially funding the tennis court replacement. Bids are being collected for the tennis court and those received to date are around $60,000. Those in attendance at the meetings felt that only funding for the playground should be included in a potential assessment. Therefore, the tennis court replacement will be funded from reserves.

Northwest Playground Equipment, Inc. has provided three proposals with various levels of equipment and pricing. Those in attendance at the meetings expressed a preference for Proposal 1. (Nine favoring Proposal 1; Three favoring Proposal 2; and Four favoring Proposal 3). Below you will find a summary of the three proposals. Renderings of these presentations are available on the website or at the board meeting. The quotes will also be available at the board meeting. All the proposals include demo, site work, materials, installation, sales tax, and warranty.

Proposal 3</br></a>

**Proposal 3**: The current footprint of the playground would remain but remove the curb the goes through the site. We would be upgrading the equipment and the safety surfacing. The cost of this proposal is $89,133.99 or $260.63 per lot.

When considering and presenting the proposed special assessment, it is important to understand the guidelines in our bylaws.  The board is required to select a proposal; identify an amount associated with it; and to present it for a vote by the homeowners.  Therefore, the board will select one of the three proposals and homeowners will vote yes or no. The board will make its selection at the next board meeting on the evening of October 16th at the Kingsgate Library. Written notice of the selection will be mailed and a special meeting to vote yes or no will be held on the evening of December 4th at the Kingsgate Library.

Should the assessment be approved, it would be assessed in the calendar year it is approved. It would be possible to spread payment across a longer time period. If this is implemented, the funds in our reserve account would “float” the playground renovations until the balance is collected to not delay construction. All members will be assessed the same amount. There will be no exemptions.

Feel free to respond to this letter or reach out to the board with questions or input as we continue this process. The back of this letter includes more information from Eric Arneson of Northwest Playground Equipment, Inc.

*A letter from Eric Arneson of Northwest Playground Equipment, Inc.:*

At Northwest Playground Equipment, Inc. we are privileged to present a full range of quality products for our customers. It is our mission to provide excellent customer service with high quality products to make your project a success! We have over 25 years of experience working with hundreds of schools, park districts, military, tribes and community groups. Northwest Playground Equipment is thankful for the opportunity to present design options for the Kingsgate 5 HOA. I, Eric Arneson, will be responsible for overseeing the completion of this design build and installation.

The playground designs that Northwest Playground Equipment is proposing emphasize achievement goals of great play value, unique design, and a place where play is undefined BUT children can take risks safely and let the imagination run wild. Our equipment ideas for the playgrounds have extensive play value allowing the children to climb, use upper body strength, improve balance, exercise, teamwork, and easily move through the play area. Our goal is to cultivate independence, free thinking, physical strength, and to create a place where imaginations can run wild. This is a playground where children can challenge themselves to explore the possibilities that encourage social, physical, and sensory skills through the avenue of play.  Below is PLAY VALUE achievements that we strived to incorporate into our designs.

**Social** - Playground creates opportunities for social-emotional learning through cooperation, negotiation, and sharing. When interacting with peers, children learn respect for rules, self-discipline, problem solving, and conflict resolution skills.

**Emotional** - Skills developed during playground play helps acquire nurturing and sustaining friendships that, promotes positive associations and reduce stressors. Free play has been found to foster self-determination, self-esteem, and self-regulation – skills critical to managing stress.

**Physical/Health** - Playground free play allows children to enjoy being physically active. Daily play builds strength, coordination, cardiovascular fitness, and moderate's childhood obesity and its associated health complications. Children are more likely to be physically active at home if they are physically active in their community.

**Play Value Goals** - Child-initiated pretend play that occurs on the playground prompts children to consider multiple perspectives, playfully manipulate ideas and emotions, enhance cognitive integration, and expand divergent thinking skills. Pretend play fosters cognitive flexibility and creativity

**Benefits of Equipment**

Our design uses the industry's most durable playground equipment, steel posts and reinforced cable ropes. The design meets all of the standards/guidelines for ASTM, CPSC, and ADA. Our design features play equipment from Playworld Systems out of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Playworld has been manufacturing quality park and playground equipment for over sixty years, and is proactive in industry efforts to increase safety while providing new and exciting play activities. Playworld is an industry leader in design, quality, safety innovation and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices by being certified Cradle to Cradle Silver. With Playworld, you get the industry's most innovative, durable and fun playground and fitness equipment plus a superb ownership experience.

Some of the exclusive features of the equipment are:

- Double Banded Single Bolt Clamp with 'S' Lap Design to eliminate string entanglements. Clamps are the safest and most durable method of attaching equipment to the support post. Playworld's clamp is the strongest clamp in the industry and is designed to meet the more stringent European safety standards for string entanglement making this the safest clamp sold in America.
- Compounded Plastics. Instead of simply coating the plastic molecule, compounding mixes the ultra-violet and color into the molecule. This means that the color of the plastic piece has better UV protection than other plastics and provides up to 23 times the strength of dry blended plastics.
- Stainless Steel, 100% tamper resistant hardware. No rust and all of the exposed hardware require a special tool to remove the bolt.
- Super Durable powder coated paint. This paint resists chalking and provides superior UV protection to keep your playground looking new longer. Super Durable Powder coatings will retain more than 80% of their original gloss after 5 years versus 30% after 2 years for regular powder coating.
- The strongest decks in the industry and resistance to canning. Our decks also have small holes to keep little fingers from being squished.
- PVC free. This means that 100% of the playground is now recyclable and consists of recycled materials.
- Color Selection: <http://playworldsystems.com/products/customization>. The playground is an open canvas for color design. Except for the Dynamo Climber.
