Hello Neighbors,

What a beautiful summer we had here in Washington! Fall is certainly upon us so what better time to glance back and share with you all how our Sizzling Summer Celebrate went. With roughly 170 neighbors in attendance, everyone enjoyed a delicious dinner from QT Food Truck and the kids had a great time decorating the parking lot with chalk, jumping rope, blowing bubbles and running off their energy in the lower field. It was truly special to see established as well as newer neighbors coming together, either meeting for the first time or catching up after a long  reunion. Speaking for myself, it reminded me of what a special community we get to be apart of and I hope that we get to do a lot more together in the coming year. Thank you to all who attended and we hope to see more of you there next year!
