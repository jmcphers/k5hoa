Greetings, residents of Kingsgate 5! We realize that living in a neighborhood with a homeowners association can, at times, be confusing. We have made this document to clarify both the spirit and the rules of our neighborhood. Kingsgate 5 has been an HOA since it was originally developed in the late 1960s, and it is our charter to maintain and supervise our neighborhood as a unified entity. Keep in mind this document is a brief overview, and not an exhaustive list of rules. Please consult our CC&Rs and Bylaws at www.kingsgate5.com for exact details.

### Community Spirit

Why do we have so many rules? It is important to remember we are a community, and not just a collection of independent houses. Whether you’re friends with your neighbors, or you’ve never talked, whether you’re gregarious or reclusive, remember we all live here together. Be neighborly, be considerate, and be aware that what you do on your property may have an impact on the people around you. Please keep your property clean and tidy as a courtesy to all of us.

### Building

If you plan to make changes to your property, whether that is substantial landscaping, new outbuildings, additions, or other outwardly-visible alterations to your house, please consult the HOA Board first to approve your plans. Most frequently, this is a simple review to make sure bylaws and codes are observed, including set-backs from property lines. We recommend consulting with your nearest neighbors before you start to avoid complaints later. You should always check with Kirkland or Woodinville about what projects require permits. City planning has rules about placement, foundations, electrical work, and expansions, among other things.

### Fences

The fencing rules are simple. Side and back fences may not be taller than 6 feet, and front yards cannot be fenced. Please consult the HOA Board and your neighbors before any fencing project.

### Occupancy

Please remember, our neighborhood is composed of single-family homes. Properties cannot be divided, nor can additional separate residential spaces be added. Properties may be rented in their entirety, but renting rooms and Airbnb hosting violate the one family rule. Group homes and businesses with employees on site are not allowed. If you have a small home business, you may need a license from the city, but the HOA requires all activity to be entirely indoors with no visible equipment or materials outdoors. Please be considerate of your neighbors when it comes to activity or noise.

### Parking

One of the common complaints we receive is about crowded parking conditions. Our rules limit you to a maximum of four cars, in good working condition, to be parked in your driveway. If you have driveway space, please do not park on the streets. Having periodic guests is fine, but regularly congesting the streets with extra cars is awkward for everyone. Furthermore, you must never park in a way that obstructs access. If garbage and fire trucks cannot pass through, or get around cul-de-sacs, you are parked illegally. The red curbs are no-parking zones.

Streets are public right-of-way, so street parking enforcement is the responsibility of Woodinville and Kirkland police. If you see a parking violation, please contact them. The HOA can only enforce parking on properties.

### RVs & Boats

If you have a boat, trailer, or an RV, it must be parked off the street behind a 6-foot enclosure fence. RVs may not be used as secondary residences. Any boats or RVs parked on the streets have 48 hours to be moved. Any on-street violation should be reported to the police.

### Public Areas

The park, the playground, and the pool are all community property for use by all residents in good standing. Please be respectful of our property and leave it as you found it, and close gates if you open them. The owner of a rental property may choose whether they or the renter may use the facilities, and should notify the HOA Board of their choice. If you see any activity which you find concerning, please contact the Kirkland Police, as they handle all enforcement at the park area.

### Enforcement

This is nobody’s favorite subject, including ours, but we must enforce the neighborhood rules evenhandedly. If we see a violation of our rules, or we receive a complaint, then we are obliged to address it, first with warning letters, followed by fines and possible legal action if the violation continues.

You are welcome to apply to the HOA for a variance to neighborhood rules, and we will vote on it at our next meeting. The decision will be final.

### Dues

All homeowners are required to pay the annual dues. All dues paid in full by January 31 will receive four guest passes for any visit to the pool as long as a homeowner is also in attendance. Dues are to be paid in full by March 31. We regret that we can no longer accommodate partial payment plans, and we have no way of offering aid. There are aid programs if you need financial assistance.

### Contacting the Board

If you have a question, request, or complaint, you can email the board at <board@kingsgate5.com>. This is the quickest way to reach us. You are welcome to attend our monthly board meetings, usually held on the second Monday of the month. They are listed on our calendar at <www.kingsgate5.com>. We hold our annual meeting every January, and we encourage you to attend. 

Thank you for being a part of Kingsgate 5.
