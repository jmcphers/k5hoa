Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowners,

As we wrap up 2025, thank you for continuing to make Kingsgate Five a great place to live. I’m grateful to our homeowners for your support and cooperation throughout the year, and especially to those who participated in events, shared feedback, and helped keep our shared spaces welcoming.

This year, the HOA focused on maintaining and improving the amenities that serve the whole neighborhood. Highlights included key pool improvements (including deck work), a strong pool season with robust programming, and ongoing upkeep across our parks and courts -- along with continued work on entrance signage and targeted tree and landscaping attention to keep our common areas safe and well cared for.

Your input directly shapes what we prioritize next. Please take a few minutes to [complete the community survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdocFUlLf8KC_NDqp2geo1f68dW0nv_lMbmCfJvtQzhyb9w8A/viewform), and provide your feedback to the board.
