Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowner,

This year has been a really different and strange time for all of us. Covid-19 limited our members' enjoyment of the park and pool. The annual Easter Egg Hunt and Association BBQ had to be cancelled. We all hope to be able to resume these events next year. As always, important information regarding dates, news, and activities for the association can be found here on our website. 

The 2021 annual meeting will be held via **Zoom** on **Monday, January 25, 2021 from 7:00 – 9:00pm**

<blockquote>

The meeting will open at 6:30pm to allow time to register and assure a quorum prior to the 7pm meeting start. You can download Zoom at <https://zoom.us> Click the resource tab and select download. There is a free version that you can use.

Please observe the following rules for the meeting:

- Please join the meeting in **mute mode** with your **name and lot number** displayed.
- If you have **questions, enter them in chat** please. We will have a board member monitoring it.
- Have your **video on with plenty of light**. Even though we are not together it is good to see faces.
- Please do not share the link with non-homeowners.
- Be patient. This is new for all of us and there will be hiccups.
- If this is your first Zoom meeting and you need help, please reach out to the board. Also, on the Zoom site you can click on the resources tab for tutorials and other training.

Important issues that will be voted on include approving the 2021 budget and voting for 3 board members for future years.

I would like to give a huge thank you to all members of our association for their ongoing support and feedback to the board. I also want to thank all the members of our homeowners’ board who support our whole community with many hours of service: Jeff Campeau - vice president; Ashley Gillen - treasurer; Susan Schilling - secretary; Sarah Starr - trustee at large and pool manager; Alan Nelson - compliance chair; James Weinrod - communications; Sarah Curde - recreation; and Bill Keating - park chair. I would particularly like to thank Dan Lund, our maintenance manager, and Sarah Starr, our pool manager, for their excellent service. Because of their hard work and commitment our pool was able to be open when most in the county and state were not. Also, thank you to Jonathan McPherson for the outstanding work keeping our website up to date with all the changes Covid-19 brought.

Highlights of this year
- Annual board meeting - in addition to budget approval, election of new members, etc.,
- Approval of grant to purchase AED for our pool.
- Pool open on limited basis during Covid-19 restrictions.

I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting. If you are unable to attend the Zoom call, please submit a [proxy ballot](pdf/kingsgate5-proxy-2021.pdf) to appoint an individual to vote on your behalf. Make sure your proxy is mailed or placed in the drop box at the pool by January 18th to make sure it can be processed before the meeting. 

Check the website for updates regarding this information and for when the drop box will be available.

Royal Hanson, 

President & Homeowner
