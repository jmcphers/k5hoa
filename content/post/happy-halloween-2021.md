Happy Halloween Kingsgate 5!

We hope you and your family are having fun searching for costumes or decorating your homes in all things Pumpkin! Though the HOA does not officially organize any events on Halloween, we are still excited to see all the trick-or-treaters out and about! For all those who feel safe doing so, join together with your neighbors and friends in walking the neighborhood in search for the largest possible candy bar! As a friendly reminder, be respectful of the homes who clearly do not look interested in receiving trick-or-treaters, or just others who are not as comfortable in participating in the evening's events.

Sincerely,

Your HOA
