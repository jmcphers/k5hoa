Someone has been putting notices on vehicles about parking violations. Though the notices claim to be from the board, the individual doing this has not contacted the board.

The Kingsgate 5 HOA may notify you about parking violations, but its notices will be on official HOA letterhead. If you receive a parking notice and are unsure whether it was placed by the board, you can always contact the HOA at [board@kingsgate5.com](mailto:board@kingsgate5.com) to confirm.
