We are incredibly excited to announce that the HOA will be hosting The Annual Easter Egg Hunt on Saturday, April 16th at 10:00 AM **SHARP** for all Kingsgate 5 residents and homeowners. We suggest arriving 5 minutes early so that your kids are in place right when the hunt begins. If youâ€™ve attended in the past, you know how quickly it ends! Please convene in the following areas depending on your child(s) age. 

Ages 0-4: Pool Parking Lot

Ages 5-7: Playground

Ages 8-12: Grassy Park Area (between playground and tennis courts)

Come prepared with a basket, a smile and get excited for treats and prizes. 

Additional Questions: please contact Recreation Chair, Carissa Haws, at <board@kingsgate5.com>.
