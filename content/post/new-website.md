Welcome to the new Kingsgate 5 Homeowner's Association Website. We've made a few changes recently to make our site easier to use.

<!--more-->

**Q. Where do I log in to the site?**

A. It's no longer necessary to log in! Most of the information that required a login is now freely accessible on our site. That's one less password for you to remember. 

**Q. What about the classifieds, message board, etc.?**

A. These areas of the site weren't often used, so we removed them. If you want to post items for local sale, you might try [Craigslist](https://seattle.craigslist.org/), [OfferUp](https://offerupnow.com/), or the [Shop and Swap 425 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/185923348153695/).

For neighborhood discussions, try [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/), or the [Kingsgate 5 Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/kingsgate5).  

**Q. I can't find something on the site that I need.**

A. Try getting in touch with our webmaster, [webmaster@kingsgate5.com](webmaster@kingsgate5.com). If your question regards the business of the homeowner's association rather than just the website, our Contact Us page can direct you to the right person.
