Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowner,

Kingsgate Five has spent 2023 enjoying gatherings as a community through the Easter Egg Hunt, the Summer BBQ, the Gators Swim Team Season, and a great season at the pool with record attendance on the first day, over 200 guests checked in this season, and over 250 children took part in swim lessons. Plans are in place for tile replacement at the pool and fixing the coating on the bottom of the pool. We are in a healthy financial position with sufficient reserves to care for our infrastructure. We are looking at potential sign replacement project in the upcoming year or two. We look forward to the continued growth of our community and a great 2024. Keep up to date with HOA news and activities at our website, <http://www.kingsgate5.com>.

The 2024 annual meeting will be held in person at **John Muir Elementary Library** on **Monday, January 22, 2024 from 7:00 â€“ 9:00pm** The library will open at 6:30pm to allow time to check-in and assure a quorum prior to the 7pm meeting start. 

I would like to thank all members of our association. Without you there would be no community. We appreciate all who attend meetings and help support the community through service or ideas. Thank you to our board who support our whole community with many hours of service. Thank you, Essex Speckhals, as vice president and taking on communications; Ashley Gillen for her diligence as treasurer; Meighan Lailey for a great job as secretary; Sarah Starr for keeping our pool the best in the area as pool manager; Bill Keating for helping to keep our park beautiful. In addition, our Gators board led by Sarah Wujick and Jonathan McPherson for upkeeping our website. A thank you for service as Alan Nelson who has been driving compliance and Carissa Haws who has headed our parks and recreation programs will be stepping down from the board this year.


We will be looking for help on the board this year with recreation and compliance. If you would like to be considered, please let the board know and we will uphold nominees at the annual meeting. I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting. If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, please submit a proxy ballot (below) to appoint an individual to vote on your behalf. Make sure your proxy is mailed or placed in the drop box at the pool by January 15th to make sure it can be processed before the meeting.

Sincerely,

Sarah Curde

President & Homeowner
