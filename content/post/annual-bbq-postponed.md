title = "Annual BBQ Postponed"

+++
The Kingsgate 5 Annual Homeowner's Barbecue was originally scheduled for Sunday, July 12. However, it has been postponed since it is unsure what gatherings will be permitted at that date, and because it is very difficult to eat a hamburger while wearing a mask.

We will make a decision at the board meeting in July concerning the Annual BBQ, and notify you via e-mail and this website whether we have successfully postponed it or had to cancel it entirely.
