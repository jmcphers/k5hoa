The Kingsgate 5 Pool will open May 29th! Presuming that King County remains in Phase 3, we will no longer require reservations; instead we're delighted to be able to return to open swim (up to 28 people!).

Information on our pool hours, parties, lessons and more for 2021 are now available on our [Kingstate 5 Pool Info page](/pool).
