Greetings Neighbors,

Our new playground will be open Saturday, June 29th at noon. Board members will be present Sunday, June 30th from 5-6pm to greet you, answer questions, and will supply a treat for all the children. We hope to see you there.

Please note the engineered wood carpet (i.e. wood chips) are fresh off the mill. They will take time to compact and weather. Please keep shoes on in the playground area.

Excitedly!

Kingsgate 5 Board of Trustees
