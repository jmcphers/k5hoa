Hello Neighbors! We on the board hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. We appreciate all the cooperation in social distancing and know this is hard on all of us. With the cancellation of the Easter Egg Hunt, we wanted to find a safe, social distancing alternative. 

**Neighborhood Social Distance Scavenger Hunt!**

Take the following list and see what you can find. If you find at least 10 items, you can email <recreation@kingsgate5.com> and submit the addresses you found them at or pictures that you took and win one prize per child that completes the hunt that will be dropped off with no contact :) 

1. How many parking spots are at the upper parking lot for the pool?
2. Find a house with a rabbit in the window 
3. Find a personal lending library 
4. Find a house with metal flowers on their gate 
5. Find a house with a Snoopy figure near their front stairs 
6. Find a house with flower spinners in the yard
7. Find the house that has a yard that is a certified wildlife habitat (this house is just outside our HOA boundaries, but worth checking out :) )
8. House with basketball hoop
9. House with a chair in the front yard
10. Find a house with tulips in the front garden
11. Find a house with the number 7 in the address
