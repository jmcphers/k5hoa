Greetings neighbors, summer is right around the corner. We are reaching out with a few timely updates and information regarding the pool and common areas.

1. **Pool Info Sheet** – We have had to make a few changes; here is the [updated pool info sheet](/pdf/poolinfo-2019.pdf).

2. **Pool Hours** – Due to staffing availability, the pool will open on weekdays at 4pm until June 23rd and at 12:15pm for the remainder of the summer. The pool will close at 4pm June 19th , 26th , July 5th , 12th , and 17th to host the Gator Swim Meets. You are invited to come cheer on the team from the deck.

3. **Pool Check-In Process** – We have a new check in process this year. The first time you visit the pool, we ask that you have reviewed and acknowledge the [updated pool rules](/pdf/kingsgate5-poolrules.pdf) (also available at the pool) as well as to verify your emergency contact information. This process will be for homeowners and resident occupants. You will still check in with your lot number each time you visit the pool.

4. **Community Garage Sale** – The K5 HOA is pleased to announce the Annual Community Garage Sale! Join us Saturday and Sunday June 1st and 2nd at 8 am. Signs will be put out on Main Roads and near the Pool. Please make individual signs as well to direct traffic to your part of the neighborhood. Advertising will be posted on Craigslist, Offer Up and Facebook beginning the week prior.  

5. **Seeking New Pool Manager** – Due to the new pool manager's unexpected relocation out of state, we are looking to hire and train a replacement as soon as possible. This is a paid part-time position; see the [full job description](/pdf/pool-manager-job.pdf) for details. To apply, email resume and cover letter to <board@kingsgate5.com>.

6. **Seeking New Board Member** – We have a vacancy on the board. If you are interested in joining the board or want to learn more, please email <board@kingsgate5.com>.

7. **Tennis Courts** – We hope you have all been able to enjoy the new tennis courts and recently added pickle ball lines. In an effort to keep the courts for homeowner enjoyment only, there is a lock on the courts. The code is `2018`. Please clean up after yourself and lock back up when you are done. Be sure to review the rules posted on the fence.

8. **Playground** – The playground renovation and replacement is moving forward. A loan has been secured. See the [final rendering](/pdf/playground/renovation-final.pdf) of the project for more info on what is being built. Construction has begun and will take approximately 4-5 weeks to complete. During this time, the playground will be closed. We will reach out when the project is closer to being finished to invite you to a grand opening towards the end of June. The rendering is available on our website and at the pool.

As always, please check the website, call the pool, or reach out to the board with any questions, comments or concerns. We hope to see you at the pool, park, and NEW playground soon.

Sincerely,

Kingsgate 5 Board of Trustees
