**Park and Playground Closed**

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to close the Kingsgate 5 park and playground areas until further notice. We don't have the resources to sterilize these properly to ensure that they do not become transmission surfaces for the virus, and don't want to encourage people to gather at the common areas in large groups.

**Easter Egg Hunt Canceled**

We've also canceled this year's annual Easter Egg Hunt for similar reasons. 

We hope to re-open soon when the worst of the virus is behind us. Stay safe and well!
