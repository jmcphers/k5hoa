The Kingsgate Gators 2021 registration is open! Register at this link:

<https://kingsgategators.swimtopia.com/register>

The Kingsgate Gators swim team are looking forward to the 2021 season, and are working hard to make it a great experience for the kids.

To reduce the stress of registration, we have a simplified process. There is a single registration window, broken out into 2 forms:

* HOA or Pool Pass
* New and Returning Gators

**HOA and pool pass** are granted preferential registration to the team. These registrations will be completed all the way through payment.

**New and returning Gators** will be completing a **pre-registration**, showing intent to join the team. On May 8th, each pre-registration applicant will be sent an email either containing a private link to register, or letting them know they are on a wait-list.

Here are the important dates:

Registration Window: Friday, **4/23/2021 5pm** - Tuesday **5/4/2021 10am**

* Registration for HOA and Pool Pass
* Pre-registration for New and Returning Gators (Intent to join the team)

Saturday, **5/8/2021**

* Email will be sent to all who have pre-registered with either a link to register, or a waitlist notification

Thursday, **5/13/2021**

* Tentative date for virtual team meeting

Please send any registration questions to <registrar.kgg@gmail.com>.
