Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowner, 

As a community, Kingsgate Five has spent 2022 bringing back some of our old favorites like the Easter egg hunt and a full season for the Gators Swim Team. We've continued to build and expand on our successful programs including the addition of toddler swim lessons. We are in a healthy financial position with our park loan now paid off and sufficient reserves to care for and replace our infrastructure as it ages. I look forward to the continued growth of our community and a great 2023.

Keep up to date with HOA news and activities here at our website.

The 2023 annual meeting will be held in person at John Muir Elementary Library on Monday, January 23, 2023 from 7:00 - 9:00pm. The library will open at 6:30pm to allow time to check-in and assure a quorum prior to the 7pm meeting start.

I would like to thank all members of our association. Without you there would be no community. And I would like to thank especially the members who have participated in our events, brought ideas or proposals to the board, or provided the board feedback throughout the year. 

Thank you to our board who support our whole community with many hours of service. Thank you Sarah Curde as vice president and taking on communications, Ashley Gillen for her diligence as treasurer, Essex Speckhals and Meighan Lailey for each taking a turn as secretary, Sarah Starr for keeping our pool the best in the area as pool manager, Alan Nelson for driving compliance, Carissa Haws heading our parks and recreation programs, and Bill Keating for keeping our park beautiful. In addition, our Gators board led by Sarah Wujick and Jonathan McPherson for upkeeping our website.

I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting. If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, please submit a proxy ballot (below) to appoint an individual to vote on your behalf. Make sure your proxy is mailed or placed in the drop box at the pool by January 16th to make sure it can be processed before the meeting.

Sincerely,

Jeff Campeau

President & Homeowner
