New Neighborhood Landscaper

Hello Homeowners,

We would like to inform you all that the HOA has hired a new landscaper, Northwest Landscape Services / Signature Landscape Services. NLS has over 32 years of experience providing full-service landscape management for commercial clients throughout the Northwest region. A few of their clients that you may be familiar with are Chateau Ste. Michelle, Microsoft and Snoqualmie Ridge ROA. NLS will continue the work of maintaining our lower field, surrounding green spaces, neighborhood entrances, sidewalks, and our grass areas along 124th Ave NE. In addition, they will now be attending to neighborhood cul-de-sacs. If you live within a cul-de-sac that has been turned into a shared garden, rest assured NLS will not interfere with those spaces. We greatly appreciate you welcoming NLS to our very special neighborhood and extending your patience should any unforeseen hurdles arise. If you have any questions please contact the HOA Board at <board@kingsgate5.com>.

Thank you,

Parks and Recreation
