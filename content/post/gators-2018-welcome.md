I would like to extend an invitation to all of our homeowner families who have children interested in swimming for the Kingsgate Gators Swim Team, which is based at our neighborhood pool. Registration for homeowners begins on **February 15, 2018**.

We are a summer swim team program made up of 125 swimmers ranging in ages 6 to 18. The swim season begins each year in mid-May and continues through July. We are part of the Midlakes Swim League, which includes 26 teams in its region. The primary focus of our program is to encourage the sport of swimming for all ages and abilities with an emphasis on technique, sportsmanship and fun. It's a great place to make friends!

We will have another meeting specifically about the swim team at the Kingsgate Library on **February 5th at 6pm**. Please join us to learn more about the team. In the meanwhile, if you want to learn more or contact us, go to our website at: <https://kingsgategators.swimtopia.com/>

Registration will be done through the website, and starting on March 1st, we will be opening registration to pool pass purchasers, and then on March 15th, we will open it to returning swimmers who don't live in the neighborhood, so please register early to guarantee your children a spot on the team.

Homeowner, and Board Member of the Kingsgate Gators Swim Team
