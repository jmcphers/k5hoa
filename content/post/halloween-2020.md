Hello Kingsgate 5!

We have received a number of queries about Halloween this year. In the interests of safety, the HOA will not be having any Halloween events this year. We ask that if you choose to participate in any activities outside your household, that you follow the guidance put forward by the Washington Department of Health at the following link:

<https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/HalloweenTips.pdf>

Any houses that wish to participate in trick-or-treating should plan to set up a table with individually-wrapped treat bags in their driveway. If you wish to observe, set up a chair a suitable distance from the table. Please avoid large gatherings and door-to-door contact, and if you go out, remember to wear a mask and observe proper social distancing. There are more details in the link provided above if you have further questions.

Have a safe and happy Halloween!

- The Kingsgate 5 HOA Board
