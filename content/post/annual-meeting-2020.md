Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowner,

This has been another great year for Kingsgate V. Good weather led to many of our members enjoying the sun and water at the pool and *NEW PLAYGROUND*. The annual Easter Egg Hunt in April and Association BBQ at the pool in July were well attended. Thanks to all who helped organize and attended these fun events. As always, important information regarding dates, news, and activities for the association can be found here on our website.

The annual meeting will be held on **Monday, January 27, 2020 from 7:00 – 9:00pm in the library at John Muir Elementary**. Among the important issues that will be voted on include the 2020 budget and 4 board positons (3 terms expiring, 1 resignation) for future years.

Once again, let me give a huge thank you to all members of our association for their continued support and feedback to the board. The board really needs this to continue for everyone’s benefit. My last thank you is to all the members of our homeowner’s board who support our whole community with many hours of service: Ashley Gillen – treasurer, James Weinrod – member at large, Susan Schilling – secretary, Alan Nelson – vice president and compliance chair, Tracy Joshi – trustee at large and recreation, Sarah Starr – trustee at large and pool manager, Sarah Curde – compliance, and Bill Keating – park chair. Also thank you to our maintenance manager Dan Lund and Sarah Starr our pool manager for their excellent service. Sarah became our newest pool manager and board trustee when she replaced Lauren Johnson whose family moved to Idaho unexpectedly. I really appreciate how she hit the ground running. Lastly, a massive thank you to Jonathan McPherson for the outstanding work keeping our website up to date and looking wonderful.

Highlights 2019

*  Annual board meeting – in addition to budget approval, election of new members, etc., those in attendance authorized the board to pursue a loan to fund the playground equipment replacement.
*  Securing loan, choosing contractor, and installation of new playground equipment.
*  Continued work with our attorney to get the bylaws and CCNRs updated.
*  Movie nights in the park.
*  Hiring new pool manager.
*  Pursuit of a grant to purchase an AED for our pool.

I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting. If you are unable to attend in person, please
