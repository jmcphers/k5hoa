Last night, we voted on the special assessment vote to replace and renovate the Kingsgate 5 playground and park. We achieved quorum with **154** votes, which were split evenly as follows:

- **77** for 
- **77** against

Because a two-thirds majority was required to pass the measure, the measure was **defeated**.
