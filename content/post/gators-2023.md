### Interested in Swim Team?

The Kingsgate Five Pool is home to the Kingsgate Gators Swim Team. The Kingsgate Gators Swim Team is a summer recreational swim team made up of swimmers ranging in ages from 6 to 18. The Gators are open to all swimmers although those who live in the neighborhood or have a pool membership get priority registration. Swim season begins each year in mid-May and continues through July. We are part of the Midlakes Swim League, which includes 26 teams in the region. The primary focus of our program is to encourage the sport of swimming for all ages and abilities with an emphasis on technique, sportsmanship, and fun. There are typically 10 swim meets (5 home and 5 away) during the regular season held on Tuesday and Thursday evenings along with practices 4-5 days a week depending on age of the swimmer. Practices are held in the evening while school is in session and then switches to morning after school lets out for the summer. The Gators are managed by a volunteer board. 

We invite you to learn more and join the team! The board will be holding an informational session for interested families on March 8th at 7pm via zoom.

### Gator Kids

The Gator Kids program is designed to give kids 4 to 6 years of age the chance to learn the sport and competition of summer league swimming. This program is NOT swim lessons. The structure will be practice two days a week and participating in 2-3 home meets, in which they race a single 25-yard freestyle. The goal for this program is to teach new swimmers how to swim freestyle across the pool without stopping and without assistance during a race. Gator Kids will be an opportunity for new swimmers to practice racing before heading into the 8 & under age group. If you are interested in this program, a google form will be available on the website during the registration window of March 13-24.
