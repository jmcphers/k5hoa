### A Word from our President

What a past few months this has been. I hope that you are doing well during
this time of unusualness. If you're like me it has been an extraordinarily
quiet summer. At our house we have been mostly staying at home with
limited gathering except in the front yard with social distancing in place. My
fondest wish is for all of this to settle down soon. We'll see.
One of the bright spots is that we have been able to open the pool. Not as
flexible as most summers but we are an exception in being open. I know this
because I (and Sarah also) have been contacted by pools as far away as
Spokane asking how we were able to do it. Sarah has done an outstanding
job understanding the rules and following them. Thanks to her and all of the
guards who are doing such a great job.

My hope for all of us is that at this time next year we'll be wrapping up a
more normal summer. I really missed seeing people at the barbeque and
egg hunt.

A reminder that the board is still meeting monthly via Zoom. In the interest
of preventing non-members from crashing the meetings we are not posting
the meeting info on the website.  If you are interested in attending contact
us for the meeting info.

### COVID-19 and Our Neighborhood

First of all, thank you all for your patience and perseverance through all the
challenges this year has thrown at us! As we head into fall, we wanted to
reiterate the rules for using the public areas in our neighborhood.

- The playground will remain closed until Phase 3 reopening occurs

- Small group social gathering in the park is permitted as long as social
distancing and mask use is observed.

- The tennis and basketball courts are available for use. Please observe
all the usage rules and regulations, and lock the gate behind you when
you leave to keep them safe from vandalism. If you need the
combination, feel free to contact us â€“ just give us your name and lot
number for verification.

- Currently, the pool and courts are for resident use only. Normally, we
would welcome homeowners to bring guests, but for now, we can only
allow permanent residents of a household. Thank you for your
understanding on this matter!

*Please remember to use a mask in public.* The current wisdom is that most
transmission is airborne, so masks reduce the chances of catching COVID-19,
and greatly reduce the risk of transmitting the virus if you have it! For more
