This has been another great year for Kingsgate Five. Good weather led to many members enjoying the sun and water at the park and pool. The annual Easter Egg Hunt in April and Association BBQ at the pool in July were well attended as was the December gathering at the pool where we enjoyed cookies and cocoa and voted for the winner of our annual house lighting competition. Thanks to all who helped organize and attend these fun events. 

The annual meeting will be held on **Monday, January 22, 2018 from 7:00 â€“ 9:00pm in the library at John Muir Elementary**. There are several important issues that will be discussed and voted on.  Among them will include 2017 financials; the 2018 budget; and voting on board members for future years.

I want to thank all the members of our association for their continued support and feedback to the board.  The board depends on that.  Any thank you would be incomplete without including all the members of the board who support our whole community: Cindy Klein - Pool Manager and Recreation Chair, Ashley Gillen - Treasurer, Alan Nelson - Vice President and Compliance Chair, Susan Schilling - Secretary, Kelly McPherson - Trustee at large and Recreation, James Weinrod - Trustee at large and swim team liaison, Lauren Johnson - Trustee at large, and Bill Keating - Park Chair. I also want to thank Dan Lund who joined us as facilities manager this year and is doing an outstanding job.

I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting.  If you are unable to attend in person, then we encourage Association members to submit a proxy ballot to appoint an individual to vote on your behalf.  A proxy ballot was mailed to you, and can also be downloaded from the [Documents](/documents/) section of our website.

Sincerely,

Royal Hanson

President & Homeowner
