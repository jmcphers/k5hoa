Dear Pool Patrons,

I hope this email finds you and your family, safe and healthy among this new and uncharted territory. We wanted to send a quick update about the pool and let you all know as much as we do.

Per state regulations, we will be able to open the pool at the start of Phase 3. This could start as early as the middle of June, or later.

Here is what that means:

**Phase 3**

- Limit 50 people (pool and deck combined) (typical average is less)
- Most swim parties and lessons will resume at regular intervals (dates to come)
- Standard fire code enforcement will apply

**Phase 4**

- Business as usual

Our goal is to continue our preparations, to ensure the pool opens as soon as possible (safely).  Over the last few weeks, we have completed virtual video interviews with all of our guards, who look forward to returning.

**Updates:**

New information, guidelines, or updated will be emailed/posted on Facebook.

Thank you all for understanding, again as things change, we will keep all of our HOA members and pool pass purchasers in mind. You all make the pool such a wonderful and fun place to hang out in the summer!

Sincerely,

Sarah Starr
