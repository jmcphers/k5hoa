Greetings Fellow Kingsgate Five Homeowners,

As 2024 comes to a close, I'm honored to reflect on a year of connection, progress, and resilience for Kingsgate
Five. Stepping into the role of HOA president this year has been both rewarding and humbling, and I'm grateful for
the support of our community and the dedication of our HOA board. Whether you attended events, volunteered your
time, or contributed behind the scenes, your efforts have helped make our neighborhood a wonderful place to live.

This year, we celebrated successes like the Easter Egg Hunt and Summer BBQ, while the pool saw one of its
busiest seasons yet, with over 300 children in swim lessons and 37 private parties hosted. The HOA remains
financially strong, with sufficient reserves to maintain and enhance our shared spaces. This year's projects included
new pool tiles, refreshed northern entrance signage, and ongoing tree and park maintenance, with plans underway
for pool deck resurfacing and further signage updates in 2025.

I also want to recognize the incredible compassion of our community this year. In August, when David Harger went
missing, neighbors came together to organize and search tirelessly for him. Special thanks to Xiaoyu, whose
vigilance led to David's safe return—your care made a lasting impact.

None of this year's successes would have been possible without our dedicated HOA board. Their hard work has
been invaluable in supporting me as I transitioned into this role and in ensuring the ongoing success of our
neighborhood. Please join me in thanking

- Essex Speckhals, Vice President and Communications: For keeping everyone informed and engaged.
- Susan Schilling, Secretary: For ensuring our records and meeting minutes are accurate and clear.
- Ashley Gillen, Treasurer: For expertly managing our finances and ensuring fiscal stability.
- Sarah Starr, Pool Trustee: For overseeing a wildly successful pool season and key improvements.
- Shelby Dickenson, Compliance: For tackling compliance matters thoughtfully and effectively.
- Bill Keating, Park Trustee: For ensuring our parks remain beautiful and well-maintained.
- Dave Williams, Member at Large: For stepping up on critical projects, like signage and fencing.
- Sarah Curde, Recreation: For her continued leadership in organizing events and fostering community, after serving as HOA president.

The 2025 Annual Meeting will be held on Monday, January 27, 2025, from 7:00–9:00 pm at John Muir Elementary
Library (doors open at 6:30 pm for check-in). We'll review the past year, vote on the 2025 budget, and hold board
elections. If you'd like to join the board or nominate someone, let us know ahead of the meeting or during elections.
If you're unable to attend, please return your enclosed proxy ballot by January 20, 2025, either by mail or at the
pool dropbox.

Thank you for your continued involvement and support. I look forward to seeing many of you at the annual meeting
as we plan for another successful year in 2025.

Warm regards,

Luke Ritting

President & Homeowner
