Dear Pool Pass Purchasers, 

We understand the frustration and disappointment of our pool issues. We are frustrated as well and apologize our communication has not been timely. This has been an unusual year for the pool and we have had a series of events that have proved to be a challenge. Our entire pool team including our professional pool service company, pool manager, and lifeguards have been working diligently to solve the problems. The safety of our pool community is our top concern. The main challenge right now is the clarity of the water. Per the health department, if we can not see the grates at the bottom of the deep end, then we need to close the whole pool. Visibility can change quickly. Our goals are the same as yours and desire a safe, clean, and fun pool environment. Please call the pool or check our website or [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kingsgate5/) before coming to swim in the upcoming days.

Kind regards, 

Kingsgate Five HOA Board
