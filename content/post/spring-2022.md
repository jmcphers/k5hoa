### Recap – Easter Egg Hunt 

To all the Kingsgate 5 homeowners who came out and participated in the 2022 Easter Egg Hunt, we would love to say THANK YOU! Your smiles, enthusiasm and motivation to hunt down every last egg was so much fun to witness. Roughly 1100 eggs were distributed along with 42 Golden Tickets collected in exchange for a selection from the prize table. Kids and adults alike enjoyed delicious donut holes provided by Factory Donuts along with coffee from Starbucks. Hopefully all who wanted got their chance at saying hello to our favorite purple Easter Bunny. Thank you to everyone who made this such a special day and we can’t wait to see you out there again next year!

### Update – Sidewalk Maintenance 

Late last year the HOA sent out a survey asking which neighborhood projects you’d like to see tackled this year. A number of our neighbors weighed in and indicate they would like the sidewalks maintained. In an effort to help keep our neighborhood looking clean and cared for, we have asked APOLS, our neighborhood landscaper, to spray for weeds along all the sidewalks. If you’d prefer the sidewalk in front of your home not be sprayed, please notify us as soon as possible at <board@kingsgate5.com>. If you are one of these individuals, we kindly ask that you do your best at maintaining that space on your own. We all share the sidewalks and want to keep them looking as nice as we can for everyone to enjoy.
