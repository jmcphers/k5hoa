Dear Neighbors,

The HOA is excited to invite all Kingsgate 5 residents and pool community members to join us on August 5th from 5:30-8:30 at the Lower Field. You will have the option to purchase dinner from Jessica's Unique Burger Bites food truck. There will also be a special frozen dessert available to all, compliments of the HOA. 

As always, **FUN** activities for kids and adults will be provided! Please come prepared with chairs, picnic blankets and/or a sun canopy (in the event of a hot day). The food truck will have beverages but feel free to bring your own. If possible, enjoy walking over together with your neighbors as the parking lot will be closed off to cars. Let's save street parking for those who need it. We look forward to seeing you all there!

Sincerely,

HOA Board Members
