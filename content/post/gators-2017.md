The Gators won the 2016 Division IV Championship for the Midlakes Swim League! Our swim team is comprised of children and grandchildren of Kingsgate 5 as well as our Pool Pass purchaser families and a limited number of nonresident swimmers.
 
Joining a swim team is one of the best things you can do to help your children be safe around the many bodies of water we have in our area. Just like the Seahawks, the Gators build their success on developing talent. If your child can swim the length of the pool, they can join swim team. The Gators' coaches have experience with children from beginners to the high school level and beyond.
 
The children and grandchildren of people who live in the Kingsgate 5 neighborhood are guaranteed a spot on the swim team if they sign up before April 1st. This includes both home owners and renters. This also includes both new and returning pool pass purchasers. Please visit the [Gators website](https://kingsgategators.swimtopia.com/) to sign up starting February 1st.
