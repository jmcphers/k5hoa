# k5hoa

This repo contains the source code for the Kingsgate 5 Homeowner's Association Website. 

## Development

The site is produced with the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site generator and a custom Hugo theme named Sunblind, which I am totally going to split off into its own repo when I have a couple of free hours. All you need to build it is the Hugo generator itself, which is a self-contained cross-platform download. Once you have it, you can develop the site locally and preview using the command:

    hugo server --theme=sunblind

The Sunblind theme actually has nothing to do with Kingsgate 5. It's named in honor of [Tim Hecker](http://www.sunblind.net/), who produces extremely wonderful music, later forays into questionable souncd sources such as organs and choirs notwithstanding. 

Nothing specific to the HOA should be in the theme.

## Pull Requests

Changes are welcome; submit them as a pull request. If nontrivial, try to validate using Hugo (as described above).
