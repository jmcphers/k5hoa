<h1>Pool Reservations</h1>

<p>Please choose one open section swim a day, and if we have openings we will be happy for you to stay.</p>

<strong>No guests are allowed at this time.</strong>

<h2>Pool section reservations</h2>

<p>Please pick which section you would like, your lot number/pool pass number and how many people from your household will be in the pool during that hour. </p>

<p>If you do not show for your reservation within 15 minutes, the reservation will be considered abandoned, and given to any members that call or come in.</p>

<p>The pool will be divided into 5 sections and allow one household/lot number per section to enjoy the pool. The baby pool will be included as a reservable section for your family.</p>
